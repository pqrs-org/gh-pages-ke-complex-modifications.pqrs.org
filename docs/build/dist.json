However, Tab is provided as an additional option, so that if you have a keyboard with two spacebars, so you can map one to Space and one to Tab, and use both as the trigger key. This mod is made for Qwerty keyboards. If you want to use a different keyboard layout, or another key as the trigger key, please download the source code and modify ergoemacs_mode.json.rb. In Zsh, the command backward-kill-line does not have a keybinding by default and the shortcut for \"Delete to beginning of line\" will delete the whole line instead. To get it to work correctly, you need to add the following to your ~/.zshrc file: bindkey \"^U\" backward-kill-line If you are using Prezto's editor module, then this is included automatically."

Sketch offer the shortcut Fn+Arrow Left and Fn+Arrow Right to switch the artboard, but HHKB can't post these key combination. And the artboard switch function aren't be listed in the application's menu, so it can't be customed shortcut in the system preference. The second rule can solve this problem. It can make the keyboard post Fn+Arrow Left key combination when the Spacebar pressed with key semicolon and post Fn+Arrow Right key combination when the Spacebar pressed with key quote, Now you can use spcebar to switch the artboard. The second rule shoud be used with the first rule, and it need to be putted under the fisrt rule in the \"Enable rules\" list."

NOTE: These (with the exception of the &lsquo;lite&rsquo;, unshifting-only mode) have no effect unless &lsquo;Colemak&rsquo; is selected in macOS's input-method configuration. This intentionally gives you a quick escape-hatch when others use your laptop &mdash; enable &lsquo;input source in menu bar&rsquo;, and then just click it and select your original layout if someone else is going to be using your computer! This is my (@ELLIOTTCABLE&rsquo;s) keyboard-layout project. I'd like to give this layout an actual homepage, once it stabilizes, with more info; but here's a summary for now: Start with Colemak&sup1; (Probably Mod-DH&sup2;); Re-arrange the number keys into a more useful, logical order &mdash; like Programmer&rsquo;s Dvorak; Swap the shifting &mdash; bring the symbols down to the default position, and require that the Shift key be pressed to access the original numbers; NYI: further re-arrange the now-unshifted symbols to optimize for common operations amongst programmers.&sup3; The current revision of this layout doesn't attempt that last one &mdash; each symbol is moved precisely alongside its corresponding number. (This is already an excellent improvement, in my experience &mdash; ! and @ being on the index fingers is absolutely excellent for DuckDuckGo and Twitter! 😉 Not to mention that this approach is very keycap-compatible, for those of us with external, mechanical keyboards.) (There's also a second, &lsquo;lite&rsquo; mode that only unshifts the symbol-row. This is useful if you can programmatically or physically remap the layout of keys your physical keyboard, but cannot programmatically swap the shift-modifier behaviour. This version is not restricted to the OS-level Colemak mapping, because it's assumed you can remap your alphas in the same fashion as you remapped your number-row, and are thus not using the OS-level remapping.) I suggest using this alongside these other modifications: Modern Space Cadet (rev 3) &mdash; Caps Lock to Escape on single press, Control on press and hold. Mouse Keys Mode v4 (rev 1) Notes: Why Colemak? This argument has gone 'round and 'round a million times, but my personal reasons are pretty simple: Proven, available built-in to every major OS that I might need to pair-program on, easy to learn for normies I may evangelize to, and there's at least a snowball's chance in hell that I'll be able to find sculpted, beautiful keycaps that actually match what th damn keys do. &mldr; unless you're like me, use an external keyboard, and would like to use sculpted keycaps that match your actual layout. See footnote 1. I have lots of plans in this direction (at the very least, Space-Cadet-Shift or not, the parentheses belong on either the index or middle fingers!); but I want to go about them in a systematic way. I've got a few databases I'd like to scrape for symbol-frequency numbers &mdash; GitHub for various programming-language figures, VimGolf for The One True Editor's controls, etceteras &mdash; as well as reaching out for feedback from specific communities — r/mk, Deskthority, the Colemak forums &mldr;. Anyway. I'm sure I'll get to it someday. Suuuuure. :P"

Now after adding this rule (\"Swap f key functions..\") you avoid assignment F1 to F1 etc. like in the first rule. Drawback: causes Touch Bar to flicker when f keys are pressed (no problem with media function keys). Best solution, allows fastest setup of a profile, but requires switching to F1, F2 as default (checkbox on)*. Now you will have F keys set as default so just select this third rule (\"Keep normal media keys funtionality...\") for the profiles, where you want to keep using media function keys as default.

For me key `left_option` started turning on anytime, causing weird symbols to appear while writing. Also it is in pressed down state always, causing every other key to behave differently. Sometimes I could not even log in as correct password is not being typed. Similar things happened with number 9 key. It started auto typing automatically. This configuration is settings for disabling 'left_option' key and '9' key (which is also a '(' when used with shift key). With these configs applied, normal behavior of key 9 will be disabled and they will only work when they are pressed with 'fn' button. So, fn + 9 will be 9, and fn + shift + 9 will be '('. Disabled keys will be left_option, 9 and shift + 9 which is '('."
