  <li>Mac users lack the Insert key on their keyboard and more specifically
  they lack the  ability to perform Shift+Insert to paste contents of their
  copy buffer. Fortunately, Mac users are able to replicate this very same

  but the Delete key on Mac keyboards is the closes to where an Insert key
  would be on a PC keyboard, allowing this short-cut to to have a natural and
  seamless feel. Additionally, there are likely no other key-bindings to be
  clobbered using Shift+Delete for inserting the contents of your copy
  buffer.</li>
