  Description
</p>
<p>
  Since Mac OS High Sierra, Apple changed how media keys work. Now they not only control iTunes,
  but also Safari, Chrome (YouTube, Facebook Video), Spotify, or other media players. It depends
  on which application is in the foreground.<br />
  The new default behavior might be annoying to someone who expects media keys to only control
  iTunes, as before. If you want to make media keys (F7,F8,F9) only control iTunes, enable this
  mod.<br />
  Use the regular F7-F9 modifiers provided here unless you enabled the "Use F1, F2, etc. keys as
  standard function keys" option in System Preferences. In this case use the Fn+F7 ... Fn+F9
  modifiers.
