  Allows Karabiner-Elements to control the ncspot Spotify client for the terminal via netcat.

  Currently this needs to be enabled manually with a CLI command (allows quickly
  turning it off/on):
  <code>'/Library/Application
  Support/org.pqrs/Karabiner-Elements/bin/karabiner_cli' --set-variables
  '{"ncspot":1}'</code>.
</p>

  There is also a workaround applied for changing Fn+F8 to be play/pause
  (because that's how I have my keyboard set up - the default setup would use
  just F8). See the generation script to easily modify this.
