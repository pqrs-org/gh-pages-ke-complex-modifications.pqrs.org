<h2>Neo2 layout</h3>
<p>Rules for the <a href="http://neo-layout.org/" target="_blank">Neo2 keyboard layout</a>.</p>
<p>Intended to be used with the <a href="https://neo-layout.org/Einrichtung/macOS/" target="_blank">corresponding keyboard layout file</a>.</p>

<h3>Base rules</h3>
<p>Base rules will only be active if the corresponding Neo2 keyboard layout is active. This means that the mod3 and mod4 keys will type their actual characters if you activate a different keyboard layout.</p>

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <td>Neo2 mod 3 key and layer 4 (Apple keyboards). Rule applied to Apple-made keyboards only.</td>
    <td><p>Toggle <code>mod4</code> by pressing both mod4 keys simultaneously.</p><p>Take this rule if you are using your Mac with a common Apple keyboard.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Neo2 mod 3 key and layer 4 (third party Mac keyboard). Rule applied to all keyboards.</td>
      <td><p>Toggle <code>mod4</code> by pressing both mod4 keys simultaneously.</p><p>Take this rule if you are using your Mac with a non-Apple keyboard that behaves like an Apple keyboard. If either the left <code>mod4</code> key or the key left of the <code>1</code> key are misbehaving, try the "Windows keyboard" rule instead.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Neo2 mod 3 key and layer 4 (Windows keyboard). Rule applied to all non-Apple keyboards.</td>
    <td><p>Toggle <code>mod4</code> by pressing both mod4 keys simultaneously.</p><p>Take this rule if you are using your Mac with a Windows keyboard or with the Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad. If either the left <code>mod4</code> key or the key left of the <code>1</code> key are misbehaving, try the "third party Mac keyboard" rule instead.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Neo2 layer 6</td>
    <td>Base rule for activating layer 6.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Extension rules</h3>
<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <td>Neo2 mod 4: Map ↖ to Home and ↘︎ to End in terminal apps.</td>
    <td>
        <p>This extra-rule lets you jump to the beginning and the end of a line in your terminal using <code>↖</code> and <code>↘︎</code> on layer 4. More precisely, it maps <code>mod4</code>+<code>a</code> to <code>Home</code> and <code>mod4</code>+<code>g</code> to <code>End</code> in the following terminal apps: macOS Terminal, iTerm2, Hyper, alacritty, kitty.</p>
        <p>Make sure to move this rule <em>above</em> the rule 'Neo2 layer 4' in the Karabiner-Elements preferences.</p>
        <p>In case you use the macOS Terminal: You need to perform an additional configuration step in the macOS Terminal preferences: Go to 'Terminal' -> 'Preferences' -> 'Profiles' -> 'Keyboard' and add the following two entries: Key: ↖ Action: \033OH and Key: ↘︎ Action: \033OF.</p>
        <p>This rule will only be active if the corresponding Neo2 keyboard layout is active.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Toggle caps_lock by pressing left_shift + right_shift at the same time</td>
    <td>Toggle <code>caps_lock</code> by pressing <code>left_shift</code> + <code>right_shift</code> at the same time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tab acts as Ctrl if pressed with another key</td>
    <td><code>Tab</code> acts as <code>Ctrl</code> if pressed with another key. If pressed alone, it acts as usual.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Prevent problematic keys (?, /, #, =, and ')') from being treated as option key shortcut</td>
    <td>
        <p>This rule serves as a workaround for issues that layer 3 could cause in some applications. See <a href="https://neo-layout.org/Einrichtung/macOS/#hinweise-und-einschrankungen" target="_blank">known issues</a> for more information. The rule maps the problematic keys to a dummy dead key on <code>Numpad 2 + left_option + left_shift</code> followed by the actual key without modifiers.</p>
        <p>This rule will only be active if the corresponding Neo2 keyboard layout is active.</p>
