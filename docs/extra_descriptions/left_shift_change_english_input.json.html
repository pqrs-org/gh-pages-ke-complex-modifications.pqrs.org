Need to enable MacOS built in Option: Use the Caps Lock Key to switch to and from ABC. <br>
Then use left_shift as the caps_lock
<ul>
    <li>Tap left_shift to change to/from ABC</li>
    <li>Hold Shift to use as normal shift</li>
  </ul>

Nice for people interchangeably use Windows and Mac, as Win use shift to switch to/from ABC
