<h4>Mute MS Teams or ZOOM with F5</h4>

<p>use F5 to toggle MUTE ether on MS Teams or ZOOM</p>

<h5>Motivation</h5>

<p>
    After trying to use the eject key version of this cmdline 
    execute i found that my M1 Macbook Pro has a Mic symbol 
    on the f5 key, so i decided to try to use that key to 
    mute in my daily used videocall applications instead.
</p>

<h5>how to use</h5>

<p>
    Use karabiner-elements Function keys tab to map the 'dictate' 
    key to use 'f5' instead if you use the function keys.
    Install this extension under tab 'Complex modifications'.
</p>

<p>
    During a Call on ZOOM or MS Teams the mute and unmute should 
    work even in background. It searches in active processes and
    if one is found it executes the corresponding ⌘⇧M for Teams
    or ⌘⇧A for ZOOM. 
</p>

<h5>Credits</h5>

<p>
    This rule was based on work done by "Toggle mic mute 
    in MS Teams with the Eject key" and the Github PR #975
    "capslock_to_mute_teams_zoom.json".
