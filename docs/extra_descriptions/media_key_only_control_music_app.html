  Description
</p>
<p>
  Since Mac OS High Sierra, media keys (⏪, ⏯, ⏩) on Apple keyboards not only control
  Apple Music.app, but also Safari, Chrome (YouTube, Facebook Video), Spotify, or other media
  players. It depends on which application is in the foreground.<br />
  This defeats the purpose of those keys as the application you want to control is already in
  focus. Making those keys only control Music.app has the advantage of being able to, say,
  pause music when you want to watch a video on YouTube in the foreground.<br />
  Use the regular ⏪, ⏯, ⏩ modifiers provided here unless you enabled the "Use F1, F2, etc. keys as
  standard function keys" option in System Preferences. In this case use the Fn+⏪, Fn+⏯, Fn+⏩
  modifiers.
